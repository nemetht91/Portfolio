                    <p>I'm a self-taught software developer who's looking for his first position within the field. I have eight years of experience in industrial automation. During my professional career, I worked with industrial robots, autonomous mobile robots, building managment systems, and PLCs. I also gained some experience in software developing. I'd like to change my carrier to do what I'm passionate about. During my journey, I familiarised myself with Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>My main responsibility was to deliver industrial and autonomous mobile robot projects, which includes creating RobotStudio simulations, supporting mechanical design engineers in the designing phase with robot selection and feasibility analyses, creating risk assessments and programming the robots. I oversaw the office's building management system and managed to increase the comfort of my colleagues by implementing an automated blind control solution. I became the product owner of the AMRConnect software which is a gateway between autonomous mobile robots and PLCs, it also collects statistics about the robots. The software is written in C# and uses RestApi to communicate with the robots.</p>

                    <p>I worked on multiple production line installation projects in various Jaguar Land Rover sites. My main duties were virtual commissioning and on site robot commissioning, robot programming and testing. I familiarised myself with several different robot application like welding, riveting, sealing, manual handling. I managed to improve the cycle time of multiple robot cells by developing a new part-searching method which helped to achieve the customer's requirement. I created several SafeMove solutions which helped to pass the customer's safety buyout. I helped to solve collision problems by re-creating the collision zones for multiple robot cells.</p>
